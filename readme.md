algernon's layout
=======================

This is an unconventional layout for the ErgoDox EZ. For more details about the
history of the layout, see my
[blog posts about my ErgoDox journey][blog-ergodox].

 [blog-ergodox]: https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/blog/tags/ergodox/

Some of the things in the layout only work when one uses Spacemacs and GNOME
under Linux. Your mileage may vary.

# Layouts

## Base layer

[![Base layer](images/base-layer.png)](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/28f7eb305fdbff943613e1dc7aa9e82b)

At its core, this is a Dvorak layout, with some minor changes. The more
interesting parts are how certain keys behave:

* The keys on the number row double as function keys, when held for a bit longer
  than an usual tap. This allows me to use the function keys without having to
  switch layers.
* The `Shift`, `Alt`, and `Control` modifiers are one-shot. When tapped, they
  are considered active for the next key press only. When double tapped, they
  toggle on, until a third, single tap sometime later. When held, they act as
  expected. My usual pattern is that I use these for the next keypress only, so
  this behaviour is perfect. If I need them held, I'll just double-tap.
* The `GUI` key is special, because when I double-tap it, it sends `GUI + w`,
  which pops up an application selector. It also switches to a one-shot layer,
  where the number row on the left half turns into app selector macros, for the
  most common things I usually want to switch to. Otherwise it behaves as on a
  normal layout.
* The `ESC` key also doubles as a one-shot cancel key: if tapped while any of
  the one-shot modifiers are in-flight (as in, single-tapped, and not expired
  yet), it cancels all one-shot modifiers. It also cancels the **Hun** layer, if
  active. Otherwise it sends the usual keycode.
* The **Emacs** and **Hun** layer keys are one-shot, the **1Hand**, **Arrow**
  and **STENO** keys are toggles.
* Toggling the **Arrow** layer toggles between the cursor arrows and the paging
  keys on the bottom row.
* The **Lead** key allows me to type in a sequence of keys, and trigger some
  actions:
    - `LEAD u` enters unicode input mode, by sending the GTK+ key sequence that
      does this.
    - `LEAD l` uses the unicode input method to enter a `λ`.
    - `LEAD s` does a lot of magic to type in a shruggie: `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
    - `LEAD y` types `\o/`.
    - `LEAD w m` maximises the currently focused window.
    - `LEAD e` makes the [experimental layer](#experimental-layer) the default.
    - `LEAD v` prints the firmware version, the keyboard and the keymap, if
      compiled with a QMK version that has these available.
      
## Experimental layer

[![Experimental layer](images/experimental-layer.png)](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/6ff50bf71248e05aab5b3fec4fae3d08)

While using the standard Dvorak layout, I encountered a number of
inconveniences, and on this layer, I am playing with ideas to make the layout
feel better. Initially, it was based on [Capewell-Dvorak][cpd], but that too,
had shortcomings I was not happy with. So now this is something inbetween, with
own observations thrown in. How it works out in the long run remains to be seen.

## Hungarian layer

[![Hungarian layer](images/hun-layer.png)](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/b160f6ec90d58c127c114c89f66e9dc9)

On this layer, the accented characters are at the same position as their base
variant. For some, which can have other diatribes, the long one is on top,
short's on bottom. Tapping any of the accented characters takes us back to the
base layer.

## Navigation and media layer

[![Navigation and media layer](images/nav-n-media-layer.png)](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/c59c453f9fe1a3238ba1494e7e5c6892)

This layer is primarily for navigating with the cursor or the mouse, and some
media things.

## One-handed layer

[![One-handed layer](images/one-handed-layer.png)](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/edff2495135955b8963198dace7f7ece)

The one-handed layer is used in situations where the right hand is occupied, by
mousing around, for example. Tapping the `OTHER` key switches which side is
active. For the most part, keys remain in their usual position. When the right
half is active, keys are mirrored to the left half.

The differences are as follows:

* The `ESC` key has been moved to the bottom row, so the `OTHER` key is easier
  to tap.
* Most keys on the thumb cluster now have dual uses, and these do not change
  when switching sides:
    - The `Space`/`Backspace` key sends `Space` on tap, `Backspace` when held
      for longer than a normal tap.
    - The `Enter`/`Shift` key sends `Enter` on short-tap, `Shift` on long-tap.
* The `Apps`/`BASE` key can be used to go back to the base layer, by
  long-tapping it. A short-tap will send the `App` key, as usual.

## Steno layer

[![Steno layer for Plover](images/steno-layer.png)](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/401ef9a84369e47c57f9aedcf0a0d667)

This is to be used with [Plover](http://www.openstenoproject.org/plover/),
nothing really fancy here. The **STENO** key toggles the layer on and off, and
sends the toggle command to Plover too.

# Building

To make my workflow easier, this layout is maintained in
[its own repository][algernon:ez-layout]. To build it, you will need the
[QMK][qmk] firmware checked out, and this repo either checked out to something
like `keyboard/ergodox_ez/algernon-master`. One way to achieve that is this:

 [algernon:ez-layout]: https://github.com/algernon/ergodox-layout
 [qmk]: https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware.git
$ cd qmk_firmware
$ git clone https://github.com/algernon/ergodox-layout.git \
            keyboard/ergodox_ez/keymaps/algernon-master
$ make KEYMAP=algernon-master
```

From time to time, updates may be submitted back to the QMK repository. If you
are reading it there, you can build the firmware like any other firmware
included with it (assuming you are in the root directory of the firmware):

```
$ cd keyboard/ergodox_ez
$ make KEYMAP=algernon
```

# Changelog

## v1.1 - 2016-06-14

* The keyboard starts in NKRO mode, bootmagic and other things are disabled.
* A [Steno](#steno-layer) layer was added, to be used with Plover.
* An [experimental](#experimental-layer) layer was added, something halfway
  between Dvorak and Capewell-Dvorak. A work in progress.
* `LEAD y` types `\o/`.
* Some keys on the [Base](#base-layer) layer have been moved around:
  - `?` moved to the left pinky, left of `Q`.
  - `=` shifted one row down, but `F11` stayed where it was.
  - `-` on the left half was replaced by `Tab`.
  - `Tab`'s original position is taken by a `Media Next`/`Media Prev` key.
  - `:` now inputs `;` when shifted.
* `ESC` cancels the [Hungarian](#hungarian-layer) layer too, not just modifiers.

## v1.0 - 2016-05-26

Initial version.
